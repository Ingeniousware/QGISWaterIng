# Smart Water Network Resilience Toolkit

## Project Overview  
Welcome to the **Smart Water Network Resilience Toolkit**! This open-source project has been developed to support the water utility sector in improving resilience against the challenges posed by climate change. The toolkit extends the functionalities of **QGIS** through a plugin for hydraulic network simulations, connected to **WNTR** (Water Network Tool for Resilience), to evaluate resilience indicators for water utilities under varying climate conditions.

This toolkit is designed specifically for the **Smart Water Network (SWAN)** community and provides a comprehensive solution to assess, monitor, and enhance the resilience of water networks against climate change impacts.

## Project Goal  
The goal of this project is to enable water utilities to better assess, plan for, and mitigate the impacts of climate change on water distribution systems, ensuring safe and reliable water services even in the face of changing environmental conditions. By leveraging QGIS, WNTR, and advanced data analytics, the toolkit supports smarter decision-making, resource management, and operational improvements for utilities.

## Key Features  
- **QGIS Plugin for Hydraulic Network Simulations**:  
  Extend QGIS functionalities to simulate hydraulic network behavior and evaluate system performance under various conditions.

- **Integration with WNTR**:  
  Use WNTR to run simulations and assess the resilience of water distribution networks. Evaluate key resilience indicators such as system robustness, reliability, and vulnerability to disruptions.

- **Climate Resilience Models**:  
  Analyze and predict potential vulnerabilities in water networks under various climate scenarios.

- **Decision Support Tools**:  
  Assist water utilities in making informed decisions regarding infrastructure upgrades, emergency preparedness, and resource management.

- **Data-Driven Insights**:  
  Leverage real-time data from smart water meters, sensors, and weather forecasts to optimize network operations.

- **Risk Assessment Framework**:  
  Evaluate potential risks from climate-related disruptions and assess the impact on system performance and community service.

## Work in Progress  
This project is a work in progress and represents an early version of the toolkit. It was unveiled for the first time during the **SWAN Conference 2025** held in Berlin. We are actively collaborating with experts, practitioners, and organizations to refine and expand its capabilities. We welcome contributions and feedback from the community to help improve the toolkit.

## Contributing  
We believe in the power of collaboration and open-source development. If you are interested in contributing to this project, feel free to open issues or submit pull requests. Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated.
